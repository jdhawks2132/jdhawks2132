### Hi, I’m Josh Hawks 👋  
**Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer**  
Texas School Safety Center · Texas State University

I build and maintain production-grade web applications used by schools, districts, and state-level stakeholders across Texas. My work spans **Rails 6–8 backends**, **modern JS frontends**, and the unglamorous (but critical) realities of infrastructure, security, and long-lived systems.

I enjoy turning complex requirements into calm, maintainable software — and I care deeply about developer experience, performance, and long-term sustainability.

---

### What I’m working on
- Designing and maintaining **large Rails applications** serving internal staff and the public
- Modernizing legacy systems (Rails upgrades, asset pipelines, auth rewrites)
- Building **React & SvelteKit frontends** where they make sense
- Shipping compliance-driven features with real reporting and audit needs
- Collaborating closely with design, security, and program teams

---

### Tech I use (and actually ship)
- **Backend:** Ruby, Rails 6–8, Sidekiq, ActiveRecord, REST APIs
- **Frontend:** React, SvelteKit, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **Infra & Ops:** Linux (RHEL/Alma), Nginx, systemd, CI/CD
- **Other:** MJML, OAuth/SAML, background jobs, data exports, reporting

---

### Outside of work
- Teaching Assistant for Washington University’s Software Engineering Bootcamp
- Former arts educator with a background in arts management
- Multi-instrumentalist (10+ instruments 🎶)
- Always curious, always learning
